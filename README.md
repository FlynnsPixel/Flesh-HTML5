![Screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png)

[Ferr2D](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/ferr2d-terrain-tool-11653) is a Unity tool that lets you easily create 2D terrain with collisions. This project takes exported mesh data from the tool and renders terrain in the [pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) HTML5 game engine. Collision is generated for the terrain using [box2D](https://box2d.org/).

## Running

Serve the project through any http server and simply run index.html!

The demo has a character that can move around the terrain with the arrow keys.
